    This is a small clojure script that queries the Minecraft API to test for all available 3 character names.

<p align="center">
    (As of 2019 the API is apparently returning "no content" to many names that are actually taken. This means the script will think the name is available, even though it isn't. This greatly reduces the utility of this script. If you know of a way around this issue, you're welcome to try to address it.
    <br><br>
    Until then, for a similar and more reliable service, you can use NameMC.
